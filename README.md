# Autonomous-Car

This is the python code I developed to be used with a Hokuyo lidar and Jetson Car. This code allows a car with a Lidar to always keep a distance of 1 meter away from a wall using a PID control. 

In the future I hope to develop this into having a car steer into shoes it detects using PID and Machine Learning.
